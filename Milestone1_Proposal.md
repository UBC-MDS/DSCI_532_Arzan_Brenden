# Proposal  

##### Overview  


##### Data  
Our visualization will be presenting violent crime data collected between 1975-2015 for 68 US cities. For every city and year, we have information for both the raw and normalized numbers for each of the following categories of violent crime:  

| Category | Raw Variable | Normalized Variable |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Homicide | homs_sum     | homs_per_100k       |
| Rape     | rape_sum     | rape_per_100k       |
| Robbery  | rob_sum      | rob_per_100k      |
| Aggravated Assault | agg_ass_sum     | agg_ass_per_100k      |
| Total    | violent_crime     | violent_per_100k      |  

The normalized variables show the  crime rate per 100,000 people for a particular city and violent crime category of interest.
